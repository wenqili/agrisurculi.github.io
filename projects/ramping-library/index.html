A renovation will soon take place, bringing a mixed-use building, meaning a hub for design major students and faculties, perhaps visitor with an interest in design.

        As both a symbol and commentary on the conditions of the new school, the making of a new facility has the potential to literally embody the fundamental principles of HUST architecture and urban planning department: newness; uniqueness; interest; logic.
